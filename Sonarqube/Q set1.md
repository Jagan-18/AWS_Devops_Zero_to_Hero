## what are you evalute in sonarqube?
SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool that evaluates software projects for various issues, including code smells, bugs, vulnerabilities, and code style violations. It assesses the maintainability, reliability, and security of code by analyzing source code and providing actionable feedback to help developers improve the overall quality of their software. SonarQube scans code to identify issues, assigns severity levels, and generates reports, making it a valuable tool for continuous code inspection and improvement in software development processes.

## Diff between sonar quality gates and quality profile?
SonarQube, a popular code quality analysis tool, uses both quality gates and quality profiles to manage and improve software code quality. Quality profiles define sets of coding rules and configurations that determine which issues should be reported in the analysis. Quality gates, on the other hand, are criteria that code must meet to be considered acceptable for a project. Quality gates typically use metrics such as code coverage, code duplication, and the number of critical issues to assess code quality at a higher level, often as a gatekeeper for code promotion in a development pipeline. In essence, quality profiles define what to look for in code, while quality gates set thresholds for code quality, ensuring that only code meeting predefined criteria is allowed to progress in the development process.

## What is quality in sonar?
In SonarQube, "quality" refers to the overall measure of the code's health and adherence to coding standards. It encompasses various aspects of code, including its readability, maintainability, performance, and security. SonarQube assesses code quality by analyzing source code and identifying issues, violations, and potential vulnerabilities based on predefined coding rules and best practices. These issues are categorized by severity, such as critical, major, minor, and info, allowing developers to prioritize and address the most critical problems first. The goal of SonarQube is to help development teams identify and remediate issues in their codebase, ultimately leading to higher-quality software with fewer bugs and vulnerabilities.

## Technical Debt in sonarqube?
In SonarQube, "Technical Debt" is a concept used to measure the long-term maintenance cost of a software project due to suboptimal or inefficient code practices. It represents the work that needs to be done to improve the code's quality and maintainability. Technical Debt is typically quantified in terms of "days to fix" or "effort to remediate," indicating how much time it would take to address all the code issues identified by SonarQube.

SonarQube calculates Technical Debt by considering various factors, such as code complexity, code duplications, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. These factors contribute to a project's overall Technical Debt, and addressing them can lead to better code quality, reduced risk, and improved long-term maintainability. The goal is to minimize Technical Debt over time by regularly addressing code issues as part of the development process, which ultimately leads to more efficient and sustainable software development practices.

## What is static and dynamic code analysis?
Static and dynamic code analysis are two different approaches to examining and evaluating software code for issues and vulnerabilities:

1. Static Code Analysis:
   - Static code analysis, also known as static program analysis or static code scanning, involves examining the source code or binary code of a program without actually executing it.
   - It focuses on identifying issues, such as coding errors, code style violations, potential security vulnerabilities, and code quality problems, by analyzing the code structure, syntax, and patterns.
   - Static code analysis tools scan the codebase for known coding patterns, rule violations, and potential problems based on predefined rules or coding standards.
   - It is typically performed during the development phase and is useful for catching issues early in the software development lifecycle.
   - Static code analysis provides a thorough examination of the code but may generate false positives and might not catch all runtime-related issues.

2. Dynamic Code Analysis:
   - Dynamic code analysis, also known as runtime analysis or dynamic program analysis, involves running the software and monitoring its behavior during execution.
   - It focuses on identifying issues that manifest only when the program is running, such as runtime errors, memory leaks, performance bottlenecks, and unexpected behavior.
   - Dynamic code analysis tools analyze the program's runtime behavior, including memory usage, CPU usage, and interactions with external resources.
   - It is typically performed on a running application and is useful for uncovering runtime-related issues that might not be apparent through static analysis alone.
   - Dynamic code analysis provides a more realistic view of how the software behaves but may not catch all code-level issues or design problems.

## what is code covrage and code smell in sonarqube?
In SonarQube, "code coverage" and "code smells" are two key concepts used to evaluate and improve code quality:

### 1. Code Coverage:
   - Code coverage refers to the percentage of your codebase that is tested by automated tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests.
   - It measures how much of your source code is executed during testing. High code coverage suggests that more parts of your code have been tested, reducing the likelihood of undetected bugs.
   - Code coverage metrics are essential for assessing the effectiveness of your testing strategy and identifying areas of your code that may not be adequately tested.
   - SonarQube can display code coverage metrics and highlight code that lacks test coverage, helping developers identify areas that require additional testing.

### 2. Code Smells:
   - Code smells are indicators of potential problems or suboptimal code practices within your source code. They are not necessarily bugs but suggest areas where code quality could be improved.
   - Code smells encompass various issues, such as long methods or functions, excessive complexity, duplicated code, inconsistent naming conventions, and unused variables or parameters.
   - SonarQube's code analysis tools automatically identify and report code smells based on predefined coding rules and best practices.
   - Addressing code smells can lead to improved code maintainability, readability, and overall software quality. SonarQube provides information about specific code smells and offers suggestions for remediation.

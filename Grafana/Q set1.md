4. **Add a New Panel**: If you don't already have a panel where you want to use the template variable, add one by clicking the "Add panel" button. Alternatively, edit an existing panel.

5. **Edit Panel and Query**: In the panel editor, configure your data source and query as usual.

6. **Create the Template Variable**:
   - Scroll down to the "Visualization" section (or a similar section depending on your panel type).
   - Find the "Add variable" button and click it.

7. **Configure the Variable**:
   - Give your variable a name, which will be used to reference it.
   - Choose the variable type based on your use case. Common types include "Query" (for dynamic data), "Interval" (for time-based intervals), and "Custom" (for predefined values).
   - Configure the specific settings for your chosen variable type. For example, if you selected "Query," you'll define the data source, query, and other related settings.

8. **Add the Variable to Your Query or Panel**:
   - In your panel's query, you can use the variable by enclosing its name in double curly braces, like `{{variable_name}}`.
   - You can also use the variable to customize panel titles, legends, and other settings.

9. **Apply and Save**: Once you've configured the template variable and used it in your panel, click the "Apply" button to see how the variable affects your data. If everything looks as expected, save your dashboard.

10. **Test and Interact**: When viewing your dashboard, you can now interact with the template variable by selecting different values or options, allowing you to dynamically change the data displayed in your panels.

By following these steps, you can create template variables in Grafana to enhance the flexibility and interactivity of your dashboards, making it easier to explore and analyze data from various angles.
